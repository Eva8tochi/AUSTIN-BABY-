<h1>HAPPY VALENTINES DAY BABBBBBBBYYYYYY!!!!!</h1>

    Hey papi,<br/>&nbsp;

Well, we did itðŸ˜‚upgraded to ðŸ’• on Snapchatâ€¦thatâ€™s something nglllâ€¦but this whole thing<br/>&nbsp;

wouldnâ€™t have even begone if you had walked passed my story on the 25th of November 2023. <br/>&nbsp;
With that, I just want to say that Iâ€™ll forever be grateful to you for walking into my life <br/>&nbsp;
because for the first time in a long time, I had someone to talk to, confide in, someone to laugh with,<br/>&nbsp;
someone to share lovely memories with. I prayed for you for months, thinking God doesnâ€™t listen to me,<br/>&nbsp;
he sorta gave me mad migrainesðŸ˜‚so that I can meet youâ€¦thatâ€™s crazyðŸ˜‚.<br/>&nbsp;

For the bad times, when Iâ€™ve caused you harm, made you feel angry, upset with me and whatnot, sincerely,<br/>&nbsp;
I apologize. Iâ€™m sorry. Truly sorry.<br/>&nbsp;

Before you came along, yeah I was alone, but I learnt how to be happy on my own and then you came to make me <br/>&nbsp;
happier. Youâ€™re smart, kind, confident, amazing, intelligent, sweet, crazyðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚my crazyðŸ˜‚, gentle, sexy ðŸ˜Œ,<br/>&nbsp;
loveable, handsome, beautiful, and I love everything about youâ€¦and the way you treat me, I love everything about<br/>&nbsp;
it. You have such an amazing personality Austin, donâ€™t change it for the world. Donâ€™t know how to close this but<br/>&nbsp;
THANK YOU, for being YOU, and Austin, I love you very much. More than you may think baby.<br>&nbsp;


Happy Valentineâ€™s DayðŸ’•<br>&nbsp;

Love Eva
